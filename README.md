# Ruby algo

This project was created to help build Ruby skills in solving common interview
coding challenges.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install:

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
[Bundler](https://bundler.io/) - manage Gem dependencies

### Installing

1. Download Repository or Copy this github url https://github.com/Nick-Damico/ruby-algo
 and run the command in terminal.
 `git clone https://github.com/Nick-Damico/ruby-algo`

2. Change Directory to `./ruby-algo` after running or downloading above,<br/>
   using command:<br/>
   `cd ruby-algo`

3. Run bundler with<br/>
`bundle` or `bundle install`.

4. Using your code editor write solutions to the code challenges in stored in the
multiple directories with `.rb` files of the same name. Tests share a similar naming
structure to the challenge `.rb` files located in the directory `spec/`.

## Running the tests

1. To Run a single test for a challenge use the command:
<br/>`rspec spec/#{challenge_name}_spec.rb`
<br/>Example: `rspec spec/fizzbuzz_spec.rb`

2. Or execute all tests with command:
<br/>`rspec`
