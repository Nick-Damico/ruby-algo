# --- Directions
# Check to see if two provided strings are anagrams of eachother.
# One string is an anagram of another if it uses the same characters
# in the same quantity. Only consider characters, not spaces
# or punctuation.  Consider capital letters to be the same as lower case

# --- Examples
#   anagrams('rail safety', 'fairy tales') --> True
#   anagrams('RAIL! SAFETY!', 'fairy tales') --> True
#   anagrams('Hi there', 'Bye there') --> False

# -- Hints
# => 1. Think of removing all none word characters, i.e. (' ', !)
# => 2. Think of using some helper methods such as charmap method
